The goal of brainlink is to adapt several functions in RAINLINK to make it rely on less external packages.
It's essentially a beta version of the RAINLINK package (https://github.com/overeem11/RAINLINK) which is used to retrieve rainfall intensity from the signal attenuation of Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs).
